        <h3>Stand Out. For Good</h3>
        <p>“Stand Out. For Good” is our primary mission, we are founded upon giving back. It’s not just what we do – it’s who we are. Locally and globally, we have partnered with over 4,000 nonprofits that provide food, clothing, resources, education, and love to children in need..
<br>
<br>
     Mission Monday connects us to our communities. When you shop with us on Mondays, 10% of net proceeds in all stores and online go directly to nonprofits across the country. Each store chooses a nonprofit from their community based on a seasonal theme, such as Education or Children’s Health. Associates are encouraged to get involved with their Misson Monday nonprofits through volunteering – every employee is given 4 hours of paid volunteer time each month. Thank you for joining our movement to Stand Out. For Good!
